# Proposal pull quote

"*Using open source, cloud-based computing we aim to integrate computational and quantitative skills more comprehensively into the EOAS curriculum, incorporating real world examples and datasets into existing courses.*"

Some definitions:  

* [Top-down and bottom up learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design)

comments:  

- bottom up instruction worked very well for the participants in this project
- when it works, students gain implicit knowledge  (i.e. "how to think like a physicist")
- but it takes time (10,000 hours, graduate school) and a particular kind of motivation

- more common outcome:  the failure of the "calculus marinade"

We (i.e. faculty) were taught bottom up, but we solve research problems top-down

Can a top-down approach involving computation and visualization replace/improve the
calculus marinade?

# Solving the prerequsite problem

* [Instructional scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding)

  Obvious advantages to modular prerequisites, the problem is logistical.



# Why now?

- The easy problems in research, industry, teaching have been solved.  Current problems
  involve complex systems, reproducibility, decision making in the face of uncertainty

- Over the last 5 years, there's been a kind of informational phase transition involving
  communication via code and literate programming.  Research, industry and teaching have
  converged on a common way to develop and communicate quantitative information.
