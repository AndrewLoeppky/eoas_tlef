# Bottom up vs. top down

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- bottom up instruction worked very well for the participants in this project

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- when it works, students gain implicit knowledge  (i.e. "how to think like a physicist")

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- but it takes time (10,000 hours, graduate school) and a particular kind of motivation

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- more common outcome:  mathematical tourists

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

We (i.e. faculty) were taught bottom up, but we solve research problems top-down

Can a top-down approach involving computation and visualization improve learning on
quantitative subjects?

# Why now?

- The easy problems in research, industry, teaching have been solved.  Current problems
  involve complex systems, reproducibility, decision making in the face of uncertainty.
  Each of these topics requires code fluency.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- Cloud computing removes the physical constraint of the computer lab.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- Over the last 5 years, there's been a kind of phase transition involving
  communication via code and literate programming.  Research, industry and teaching have
  converged on a common way to develop and communicate quantitative information.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- These open source development tools allow the rapid creation/testing/maintainence of
  instructional material customized for individual student preparation and interest.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- Our workflow for teaching quantitative topics itself provides an example of how problems
  get solved by practioners.  Students can actively participate in 
  a live scientific community, getting them out of the "sandbox".
